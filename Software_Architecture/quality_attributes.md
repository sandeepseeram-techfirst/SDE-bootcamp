#### Availability

Defined as the proportion of time that the system is up and working

Can be measured as a percentage of total system downtime over a predefined time period

#### Maintainability 

Defined as the ability to undergo changes as required

Can be measured by calculating the time it takes to undergo the changes as required

#### Performance

An indication of the responsiveness of a system to execute our commands within a given interval of time

Can be measured in terms of latency or throughput

#### Reliability

Defined as the chances that a product will perform its intended behaviour under the defined circumstances

Can be measured in terms of the correlation between two scores of test-retests

#### Reusability

If we can use the product, or some specific part of the product, in the production of any other product

Can be tested by evaluating the software system’s functionality in different scenarios, testing modularity and compatibility, and assessing the performance and integration abilities

#### Security

Measures taken to protect the system and its resources from unauthorized access and attacks

Can be tested via penetration testing, security code reviews, security testing tools, security assessments, user acceptance testing, and production monitoring

#### Scalability

Defined as a scale of the system’s increasing or decreasing capability

Can be measured in terms of its capacity to extend or reduce the quantity of user requests

#### Load balancing

Defined as a technique used to distribute workloads evenly across multiple computing resources to optimize resource utilization, increase reliability, and improve scalability

Can be measured by evaluating the distribution of incoming requests among the servers, response time, resource utilization, and the reliability of the system

#### Caching

The temporary storage of frequently accessed data in a fast-access memory to reduce the number of expensive I/O operations, speed up access to the data, and reduce response time
