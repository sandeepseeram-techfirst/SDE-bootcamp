### What is platform engineering? 
###### Platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building toolchains and workflows that enable self-service capabilities for software engineering organizations in the cloud-native era.

### Internal Developer Platform (IDP)
######  A self-service developer centric portal with operational necessities of the entire lifecycle of an application. 

### Advantages 
##### Platform Engineering reduces the friction in software delivery by providing standardized tools and services to enterprise delivery teams allowing them to focus on creating business value rather than getting bogged down by the platform complexity. 

1. Reduce the cognitive load on product teams and thereby accelerate product development and delivery
2. Improve reliability and resiliency of products relying on platform capabilities by dedicating experts to configure and manage them
3. Accelerate product development and delivery by reusing and sharing platform tools and knowledge across many teams in an enterprise
4. Reduce risk of security, regulatory and functional issues in products and services by governing platform capabilities and the users, tools and processes surrounding them
5. Enable cost-effective and productive use of services from public clouds and other managed offerings by enabling delegation of implementations to those providers while maintaining control over user experience

###### Gartner states: “By 2026, 80% of large software engineering organizations will establish Platform Engineering teams as internal providers of reusable services, components and tools for application delivery.”
