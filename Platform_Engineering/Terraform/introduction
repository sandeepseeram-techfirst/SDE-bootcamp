#### Terraform 
Terraform is an open source infrastructure-as-code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure.


#### verify your temporary access to the AWS account

$ aws sts get-caller-identity
{
    "UserId": "AIDAVSADL6QAAPQHXWJPM",
    "Account": "382259164160",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::382259164160:user/user-vsnfomffhgxy"
}


#### terraform fmt 
to ensure proper formatting and readability of your code

- Installed hashicorp/aws v5.47.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.


terraform init to download the AWS provider code locally (in a hidden .terraform folder)

$ terraform validate
Success! The configuration is valid.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

run "terraform apply" now.
