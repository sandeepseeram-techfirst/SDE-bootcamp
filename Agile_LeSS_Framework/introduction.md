#### Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)

Agile teams are made up of product owners, scrum masters, software developers, and others who work collaboratively to address complex problems through the creative delivery of valuable products. Scrum is one of the more popular agile methodologies that teams use to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products. Yet only recently have we effectively addressed scaling scrum in the enterprise with scaled agile process frameworks like Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS).

What is the LeSS framework? 
LeSS is a framework for scaling scrum to multiple teams who work together on a single product. It starts with a foundation of one scrum team, as defined by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in the Scrum Guide, and applies to multiple teams who work together on one product. 

The LeSS framework seeks to apply the principles and ideals of scrum in a large-scale enterprise context as simply as possible through defined rules and guides. Its simplicity has earned LeSS the label of being a “barely sufficient” framework, but that’s not meant to cast it in a negative light.

LeSS was forged through more than 600 experiments that involved expanding the practice of scrum, which at the time was thought to only support small, colocated groups. The LeSS experiments, guides, frameworks, and principles were created to support the needs of larger numbers of teams. In addition, LeSS rules were later released to better define and provide guidance on how to implement and execute LeSS and offer guides for adoption.
