#### Rate Limiting Pattern 

Many services use a throttling pattern to control the resources they consume, imposing limits on the rate at which other applications or services can access them. You can use a rate limiting pattern to help you avoid or minimize throttling errors related to these throttling limits and to help you more accurately predict throughput.
