#### Gateway Aggregation pattern
Use a gateway to aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request. This pattern is useful when a client must make multiple calls to different backend systems to perform an operation.

To perform a single task, a client may have to make multiple calls to various backend services. An application that relies on many services to perform a task must expend resources on each request. When any new feature or service is added to the application, additional requests are needed, further increasing resource requirements and network calls. This chattiness between a client and a backend can adversely impact the performance and scale of the application. Microservice architectures have made this problem more common, as applications built around many smaller services naturally have a higher amount of cross-service calls.
