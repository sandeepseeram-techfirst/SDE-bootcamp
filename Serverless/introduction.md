#### Serverless 

Serverless architecture (also known as serverless computing or function as a service, FaaS) is a software design pattern where applications are hosted by a third-party service, eliminating the need for server software and hardware management by the developer. Applications are broken up into individual functions that can be invoked and scaled individually.


The Serverless Framework â€“ Makes it easy to use AWS Lambda and other managed cloud services to build applications that auto-scale, cost nothing when idle, and overall result in radically low maintenance.
