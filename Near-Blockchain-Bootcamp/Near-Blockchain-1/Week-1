There are many advantages that a typical centralized architecture cannot provide:

#### Trust
Value transfers are operated in a peer-to-peer fashion, without trusted third-parties. That way, users are not dependent on a central entity or platform.

#### Censorship resistance
Because a central entity does not operate the network, it cannot be shut down by one particular entity. Reaching a Consensus is required to change the state of the network.

#### Availability
A decentralized system is more robust as there is no central point of failure.

#### Transparency
All interactions and states are stored immutably on the blockchain and publicly available for anyone to review.
